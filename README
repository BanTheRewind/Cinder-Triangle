Delaunay triangulation for Cinder. It wraps and is based on
Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's classic "triangle.c".

The triangulation result of this block is the exact same as Cinder's 
triangulation, however the output is very different. Instead of creating 
a TriMesh2D, ciTri outputs a vector of Triangle objects, containing 
position and size data for each triangle.

This is especially useful in 2D physics or when breaking up an outline.

WISH LIST:

- 3D triangulation
- Options to use Voronoi math to subdivide the triangles to 
  more even shapes
