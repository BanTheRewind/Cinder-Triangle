Delaunay triangulation for Cinder. It wraps and is based on
Jonathan Richard Shewchuk's classic "triangle.c".

The triangulation result of this block is the exact same as Cinder's 
triangulation, however the output is very different. Instead of creating 
a TriMesh2D, Cinder-Triangle creates a vector of Triangle objects, 
each with position and size data.

This is especially useful in 2D physics or when breaking up an outline.

This is a work in progress.  On the to do list...

- 3D triangulation
- Advanced sample (same as basic, but triangles can be moved)
- 3D terrain sample
- XCode sample projects and static lib ( OSX + iOS )
