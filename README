Triangle class for Cinder.  This is to measure and manipulate 
triangles.  Think of it as an analog to the Rectangle class.

This is a work in progress.  On the to do list...

- Add math to advanced sample
- 3D terrain sample (2D tri + Z for height)
   - Map triangles back to source index (needed to obtain Z)
- Voronoi sample
- Sierpinski sample
